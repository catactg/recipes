## Description
I often found myself searching over and over again for certain recipes. Sometimes I would find them. Sometimes I would not. So I decided to start a collection of my most beloved recipes so that my *future-self* can enjoy that perfect guacamole.

These recipes have been tested under the following circumstances:
- Dinner for two
- Family birthday
- PhD graduation party
-
- 

[Add to the list other circumstances to test the recipes]
