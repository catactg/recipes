## Description
I often found myself searching over and over again for certain recipes. Sometimes I would find them. Sometimes I would not. 

So I decided to start a collection of my most beloved recipes for my *future-self* to enjoy that perfect guacamole.

These recipes have been tested under the following circumstances:
- Dinner for two
- Family birthday
- PhD graduation party
[Add to the list other circumstances to test the recipes]

## Requirements
- Kitchen
- Utensils
    - Bowls
    - Spoon
- Ingredients
    - Salt

[Complete the list of requirements. Use indented lists too.]
